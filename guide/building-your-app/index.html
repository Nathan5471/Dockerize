        <h2>Building Your App</h2>
        <h3>The Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          The frontend is probably the most important part of your application.
          It is the way people actually interact with your app. If your
          interface sucks, people are not going to enjoy using your project.
        </p>
        <h4>Frameworks</h4>
        <p>
          Since your project will need to interact with your backend, I would
          reccomend using a framework, rather than plain HTML and CSS. Some
          popular frameworks are React and Vue for JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>The Backend</h3>
        <p>
          The backend is where a lot of the logic of your application will go.
          For this guide it will also be serving your frontend, but it is also
          possible and sometimes recommended to serve your frontend separately.
          The backend is the connection between the frontend and the database.
        </p>
        <h4>Frameworks</h4>
        <p>
          There are lots of backend frameworks to choose from. Some popular ones
          are Express for JavaScript and Django, Flask, or FastAPI for Python.
          It is also recommended to document your API using something like
          Swagger (OpenAPI).
        </p>
        <h3>The Database</h3>
        <p>
          The database is where all of your applications data is stored. There
          are many options like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more. SQLite
          will be the easiest option since it is just a file and you don't have
          to host a server for your database in addition to your backend. This
          guide will show you how to set up SQLite or PostgreSQL with your app.
