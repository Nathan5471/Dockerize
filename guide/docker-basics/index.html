        <h3>What is Docker?</h3>
        <p>
          Docker is a platform that allows you to easily deploy your projects in
          something called a container. A container is similar to a virtual
          machine as it allows you to run your project in an isolated
          replicatable environment. Where is differs from a virtual machine is
          that it is much more lightweight and uses low-level mechanics of your
          operating system. This makes it so much faster to deploy your
          projects. It also gets rid of the "it works on my machine" problem
          since the container will run the same way on any machine that has
          Docker installed. If you want to learn more check out the

        <h3>How can I run a Docker application?</h3>
        <p>
          The first step is to install Docker if you haven't already:
          <a
            href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/</a
          >. After that, there are two methods to run a Docker container: Docker
          Compose and Docker Run.
        </p>
        <h4>Docker Compose (Highly recommended and far superior)</h4>
        <p>
          Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multiple or
          multi-container Docker applications in a single .yaml file. In the
          docker-compose.yaml file, you define your application with things like
          the image to use, ports, environment variables, and more. After you
          have defined your containers, you can run then all with the simple
          command "docker-compose up" in the same directory as your
          docker-compose.yaml file. You are also able to do "docker-compose up
          -d" to run it in the background. There are many other helpful commands
          like "docker-compose down" to stop and remove the containers and
          "docker-compose pull" to update the images that the containers are
          based off of.
        </p>
        <h4>Docker Run</h4>
        <p>
          The Docker Run command is an alternative to Docker Compose. It allows
          to run a container in the command line with only a single command. To
          set things like ports and environment variables, you use flags like
          "-p" for ports and "-e" for environment variables. After setting up
          lots of containers with Docker Run, it can get messy and much harder
          to manage compared to Docker Compose. I also find it useful since
          sometimes I need to edit something like the port and it's so much
          quicker to just edit the file instead of trying to find the command I
          used to run the container.
